                <p>Before going into what devOps is I will try to cover how this word is derived. If you can just look
                    at
                    the word “devOps” it certainly looks a combination of dev and Ops. Here dev refers to the
                    Development
                    and Ops refers to the Operations.</p>

                <p>In back days operations department was responsible for the deployment of builds (applications) and
                    there
                    was less or no involvement of the development team members in the deployment process. But there
                    always a
                    syncing problem exists between the developers and the operations team members resulting in extended
                    timeline in the deployment of the build or say build coming under production so that they can be
                    used by
                    the end users.</p>




                <p>What the hell are you talking about? we were still able to perform the deployment in those times too,
                    what devOps changed?</p>

                <p>Perfect question. devOps collaborated the developers to work with operations teams at the same time.
                    What resulted in no syncing issues, if there exists any deployment issues due to some failure
                    happening
                    due to the build provided by the development team, the resolution happens within time making the
                    operations team to deploy the build into production without any extension in the timeline.</p>

                <p>is that it?</p>

                <p>No, its not over yet. devOps can be completely an automated process, how we will learn into coming
                    articles.</p>

                <p></p>i hope you are coming after reading this article as here i have explained what exaclty devOps is and why
                are we going through this process. in this article i will brief some more information on devOps by
                depicting some images below so that a good insight can be made on it.

                <p></p>so, what challenges does devOps solves?
                when the teams work separately and by team i mean the dev, QA and the ops, Dev is often unaware of QA
                and Ops blockers that prevent the program from working as expected, at the other hand QA and Ops are
                typically working across many features and they have little context of the business purpose and value of
                the software by this what we see that each group has quite resisting goals which can lead to
                inefficiency or you can say fingure pointing when something goes wrong.



                <p></p>and here devOps addresses these challenges by bridging and creating a cross functional teams that shares
                responsibility of maintaining the system that runs the software.

                <p></p>reference: https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/devops-in-a-scaling-environment-9d5416ecb928
                you can see how devOps collaborates the process of development, testing and deployment.

                <p></p>just to make everyone clear that, devOps is not a tool. i am into the phase of learning it and i have
                find its more of a process or you can typically say a culture that needs to be adabpted to work in. what
                i have experienced so far is, as much as you dig yourself into this culture you will enjoy the workplace
                you have established for yourself. devOps deals with such real time scenarios where you can not be late,
                it has to be bang on or you will have to face loses as well.



                <p></p>its not just a healthy culture in the technology era but you will find devOps around you yourself for
                sure in life lessons as well

                <p></p>will catch you real soon with some more realistic technical writings with philosophical thinking.
