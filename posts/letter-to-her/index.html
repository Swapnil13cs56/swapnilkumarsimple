            <p>i seriously have doubt how to start this letter so i'm writing whatever is hitting into my mind right now.
            first of all i hope you are doing well enough and you're still having that smile on which i m flattered
            forever. i know its been so many days and you must came to a thought of "why i didnt tried to convince you
            and make things back to normal and happening?", and my answer to this question is, "i really dont know".
            from that day i use to go for a walk which is not regular but yes i did go for it, and everyday while
            walking and listening to songs i think about you and you only. but at the same time i feel like i donot
            really know how exactly i have to feel on this, or react on this, may be i have lost the knowledge to react or to
            think, i dont know. but its really quite mixed.</p>

            <p>obviously i miss you every single day and to be honest every hour of the day, i pick up the phone, i open
            whatsapp i navigate to the chat but its all dry there, nothing is happening. i recently had a talk with
            behen and i told her about this and she said that you still have a lot of time for whatever reason you are
            fear of so why creating a distance so early, i did replied her but i dont know i said the right thing or it
            was just that i want you to be happy so i said her those things.</p>

            <p>never mind, let me tell you something, the migration i was fear of went well, and i recently had a chat with
            Naveen sir and he is thinking of changing my profile from SSE in test to some profile in DevOps. i really
            wanted to have a lot of talks with you on phone but i hope to make it real soon. see you're always infront
            of me, i see you every day while working while doing anything, i have my eyes on you so dont you dare.
            things dont go well everytime doesnt mean that it will go the same always, good days will come soon. btw our
            office is closed for walk in till december, so till time its only wfh.</p>

            <p>i hope your UI issues are being resolved with less of an effort, and i know you're doing fantastic in the
            work, but still you are free to make some mistakes obviously and call me to have a discussion on the bug,
            just telling.</p>

            <p>life is obvioulsy not the easiest of the rides that we can take, but i dont want to miss the adventurous
            ones as well, so you know what i mean right, see you are perfectly fine with the fear you have and i respect
            that and i m not forcing you which i cant for obvious to make any decisions right? but at the same time i
            really want you to stay as you were, as i met you for the first time, as i found you for the first time, the
            smile, the talks everything</p>

            <p>there is no point to conclude in this letter, and to tell you, its not the first and last but will continue
            to write and dont stop me please,haash you can stop me for sure.</p>

            <p>just be happy babe, keep smiling, keep shining...meet me soon</p>
